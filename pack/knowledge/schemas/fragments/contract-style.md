description: The binding-surface standard every contract document follows, included into each contract-kind schema.

**Contract style — a contract is a binding surface, not a
specification** (superdev ADR-029):

- Each normative statement MUST use an RFC 2119 modal verb, one
  requirement per sentence.
- An enumerable surface — commands, flags, keys, types, error cases,
  limits — MUST be defined in the kind's native structured form: a code
  block, table or list. Prose, doc comments included, describes and
  MUST NOT define.
- A contract MUST bind only what callers rely on; behaviour a contract
  does not list is the code's to decide.
- A contract MUST link the ADR behind each decision and MUST NOT
  restate the ADR's reasoning.
